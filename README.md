Grace is a Discord bot in development, the goal is to be the more complete as possible, keeping a good performance.
What Grace can do for now:
  - Essential features: user reactions, ban/kick command, purge messages, show a user profile picture, play songs with playlist for guilds.
  - Another features: Try to find a specific user by his display name (you can test it with the Discord profile picture command), allow users to have their personal song playlist and add songs to the guild queue from it.

Requeriments: Redis (it's more easy to install it on Windows 10 now with it's new feature) and FFmpeg(easy to install it on Windows 10 too, with Chocolatey, [check it here](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ffmpeg)), both can be installed on a Linux system with simple commands! Another requeriments are installed by the npm.
